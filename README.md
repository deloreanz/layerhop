# LayerHop

## Setup
This project was bootstrapped on top of this great guide to setup a React Dapp locally.

## Scaling Ethereum Hackathon Goals
- React Daap that allows cross-chain (Polygon to Ethereum) coin transfer using Connext
- Superfluid token transfer cross chain, stream in to one side, stream out on the other
- Meta tx cross chain, economic incentive for the 'Shippers' to bundle other users' txs trustlessly
- Allow meta tx to invest on L1 from L2 per user
- Annuity streams

## Working with testnets

### Faucets
Gets Polygon/Matic and Ethereum/Goerli testnet coins (MATIC, DERC20/TEST, LINK) from this faucet.  Once the coins are transfered, you can get their addresses to add to Metamask so their balances will show up.
